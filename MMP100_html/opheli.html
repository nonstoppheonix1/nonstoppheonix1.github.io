        <h2>A Sturling decision!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>You hop onto the vehicle and don't hesitate to go airborne!</p>
        <p>As you fly closer to the man, you notice he's caught in a current! The setting isn't too safe for flying low, too!</p>
        <p>There are two options; either get as close as possible to the man and attempt to catch him with a rope, or hope for the best and trail him to have a better shot!</p>
        <a href="heliBADEND1.html"> <h1>Fly down close to the man and cast out a rope!</h1> </a>
        <p> </p>
        <a href="heliBADEND2.html"> <h1>Trail behind the man in the heavy current until it calms down, maybe? </h1> </a>
