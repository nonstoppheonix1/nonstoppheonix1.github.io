        <h2>Excellent choice!</h2>
             <header> Nothing more straightforward for a river rescue than a boat!</header>
        <p>You and the rescue team hop aboard the boat, take the wheel, and race towards the man; who is getting swept away quicker from the strong current! Oh no!</p>
        <p>The boat gets caught in the current!</p>
        <p>You have two options; option one is to slow down and pace yourself to avoid getting swept away,
            or you can speed up, risking the wrath of the waves. </p>
